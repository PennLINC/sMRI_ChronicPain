# CODE DOCUMENTATION
The following describes all the steps that need to be performed for replication including set up, statistical main and subanalyses as well figure generation and result interpretation. 

## 1. Setup
The following softwares are needed for the analyses:
* [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
* [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/)
* [BrainNet Viewer](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/)
* [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL)

After you have downloaded the software, proceed as follows: 
1. download [GitHub repo].
2. move the *spm12 folder* and *BrainNet Viewer folder* to the **dependencies folder**. 
3. go to the folder **ale**:
    - Create two new subdirectories and name them **DataMatlab** and **DataRaw**.
    - The entered data will be saved here later

If you are running the analyses on a Windows computer, please follow the next steps (otherwise go on to **2. ALE Metaanalysis**)


## 2. ALE Metaanalysis
4. open the script *runALE.m* in MATLAB. 
    - You will need this script to perform the analyses.
