# CODE DOCUMENTATION
The following describes all the steps that need to be performed for replication including set up, statistical main and subanalyses as well figure generation and result interpretation. 

## 1. Setup
The following softwares are needed for the analyses:
* (MATLAB) [https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html]
* (SPM12) [https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/]
* (BrainNet Viewer) [https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/]
* (FSL) [https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL]

After you have downloaded the software, proceed as follows: 
1. download GitHub repo.
2. move the spm12 and BrainNet Viewer folders to the dependencies folder. 
3. go to the folder ale
 Create two new subdirectories and name them DataMatlab and DataRaw. This is where the entered data will be stored later.
4. open the script runALE.m in MATLAB. You will need this script to perform the analyses.
